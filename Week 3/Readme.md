# Advanced Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (Week 3)

**Overview:**
This repository documents an advanced Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)
exercise focusing on exploit chaining, web application penetration testing, post-exploitation,
and full-cycle pentesting.

All activities were conducted in a controlled lab environment using vulnerable virtual machines.

**Objectives:**
Perform advanced exploitation and exploit chaining
  Customize and execute Metasploit and public exploits
  Conduct manual and automated web application testing
  Practice professional reporting and stakeholder communication
  Perform post-exploitation and evidence collection
  Execute a full VAPT capstone project

**Tools Used**
  Kali Linux
  Metasploit Framework
  Nmap
  SQLmap
  Burp Suite
  Nikto
  OWASP ZAP
  OpenVAS
  Wireshark
  Draw.io

**Lab Environment**
  Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
  Targets:
    Metasploitable 2
    DVWA
    Kioptrix Level 1
  Virtualization: VMware Workstation

**Key Activities**

**1. Advanced Exploitation**
- Reconnaissance using Nmap
- Exploit chaining using Metasploit (Unreal IRC backdoor)
- Successful shell access and privilege escalation

**2. Web Application Penetration Testing**
- Automated testing using SQLmap and OWASP ZAP
- Manual testing using Burp Suite
- Identified SQL Injection and Reflected XSS vulnerabilities

**3. Reporting & Communication**
- Executive summary and technical findings
- CVSS scoring and remediation planning
- Network attack path diagram

**4. Post-Exploitation**
- Session upgrade (Shell → Meterpreter)
- Evidence collection and file hashing
- Maintaining integrity of collected artifacts

**5. Capstone Project**
- Full VAPT cycle against Kioptrix VM
- Scanning, exploitation, and verification
- OpenVAS vulnerability validation
