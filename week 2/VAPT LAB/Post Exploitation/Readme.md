**Overview**

This section documents the Post-Exploitation phase of the VAPT lifecycle.
The goal of this phase was to maintain access, identify privilege escalation opportunities, and collect evidence after successfully exploiting the target system.

Post-exploitation helps assess the impact of a successful attack and the level of access an attacker can achieve.

**Lab Environment**

Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
Target Machine: Metasploitable2
Access Type: Meterpreter session
Session ID: 1

**Tools Used**

Meterpreter
Metasploit Post-Exploitation Modules
sha256sum (evidence hashing)

**Step 1: Confirm Meterpreter Session**

After successful exploitation, an active Meterpreter session was established.

An active session was confirmed and selected for post-exploitation activities.


**Step 2: System Enumeration**

Basic system enumeration was performed to understand the compromised environment.

**Step 3: File System Access Validation**

File system access was verified to confirm control over the target system.

This confirms successful post-exploitation access.

**Step 4: Privilege Escalation Enumeration**

The Metasploit local exploit suggester was used to identify potential privilege escalation vectors.

**Step 5: Privilege Escalation Attempt**

The module identified multiple potential local exploits.

**Outcome**

Several exploits were tested
No successful root or SYSTEM session was obtained
This indicates partial hardening of the target system.

Conclusion

The post-exploitation phase successfully demonstrated the risks associated with an initial compromise.
While privilege escalation was not achieved, the ability to access system files and enumerate vulnerabilities highlights the importance of defense-in-depth and system hardening.
