**#Overview**

This section documents the Vulnerability Scanning phase of the VAPT lifecycle.
The objective of this lab was to identify, analyze, and prioritize security vulnerabilities on a Metasploitable2 virtual machine using automated scanning tools in a controlled lab environment.

**#Lab Environment**
 
Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
Target Machine: Metasploitable2
Target IP: 192.168.10.16
Network Type: Bridged Network

**Tools Used**

Nmap – Service and version detection
Nikto – Web server vulnerability scanning
OpenVAS (GVM) – Comprehensive vulnerability assessment


**Step 1: Network & Service Enumeration (Nmap)**

Before running vulnerability scanners, an initial scan was performed to identify open ports and running services. The purpose of this step was to identify the open ports, service versions and attack surface.
nmap 192.168.10.16 -sV

The output of this file was saved into the nmap_scan.md


**Step 2: Web Vulnerability Scanning (Nikto)**

After identifying HTTP services, Nikto was used to scan the web server for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, For detecting files and directories.
nikto -h http://192.168.10.16/

The output of this scan was saved into the Nikto_scan.md


**Step 3: Vulnerability Assessment (OpenVAS)**

OpenVAS was used to perform a full vulnerability assessment on the target system.

**Installation & Setup**
sudo apt install gvm
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-start

The OpenVAS web interface was accessed at:
https://127.0.0.1:9392/


**Step 4: OpenVAS Scan Configuration
Actions Performed**

Created a Target with IP: 192.168.10.16
Selected OpenVAS Default Scanner
Chose Full and Fast Scan Configuration
Started the scan task


**Step 5: OpenVAS Scan Results**

The OpenVAS scan identified multiple critical and high-risk vulnerabilities on the target system.

The Vulnerabilities can be saved in a file called as Vulnerability_table.md


**Step 6: Vulnerability Prioritization**

All identified vulnerabilities were prioritized using CVSS v3 scores.
**
Priority Mapping
**
Critical: CVSS 9.0 – 10.0
High: CVSS 7.0 – 8.9
Medium: CVSS 4.0 – 6.9
Low: CVSS < 4.0

This prioritization helps determine which issues require immediate remediation.


**Conclusion**

The vulnerability scanning phase successfully identified multiple critical security weaknesses in the target system. These findings demonstrate the risks of outdated software, weak credentials, and insecure service configurations, forming the foundation for further reconnaissance and exploitation activities.


The final output was saved as OpenVAS Scan Report.pdf
